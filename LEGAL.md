## API Terms of Use

Use of the Trendyol Marketplace Product Integration APIs through this plugin is subject to Trendyol's Developer Terms of Service and API Usage Policy.

- Developer Portal: https://developers.trendyol.com
- API Application & Permissions: https://developers.trendyol.com/docs/marketplace-entegrasyon-bilgileri/basvuru-ve-izinler

By using this plugin, you agree to comply with all applicable Trendyol API terms. API access requires valid credentials (API Key, API Secret, Supplier ID) issued by Trendyol.

---

## Covered API Scope

This plugin provides tooling for the following Trendyol Marketplace API domains only:

- Trendyol Marketplace — Product Integration API (TR)
- Trendyol Marketplace — Product Integration V2 API (TR)
- Trendyol International Marketplace — Product Integration API

No other Trendyol API domains (Orders, Shipments, Finance, Claims, Questions & Answers, etc.) are in scope. This plugin does not interact with those APIs.

---

## Data Handling

This plugin does not collect, transmit, or store any user data.

Specifically:

- **API credentials** (API Key, API Secret, Supplier ID) are never read, stored, or transmitted by the plugin. They appear only in generated curl examples as placeholder values.
- **Request payloads** submitted for validation are processed by the Trendyol Developer Tools MCP server. No payload data is stored or transmitted by the plugin itself.
- **API responses** are not intercepted or stored by the plugin.
- **No telemetry** is collected by this plugin.

---

## Liability

This plugin generates example payloads, curl commands, validation results, and implementation guides for development and testing purposes.

**The following are the sole responsibility of the integrating party:**

- Any requests sent to the Trendyol production API (`https://apigw.trendyol.com`) using credentials provided by the user
- Correctness and completeness of the final integration implementation
- Compliance with Trendyol's API terms and rate limits
- Data accuracy in submitted product listings

Trendyol provides this plugin as a developer productivity tool. It does not guarantee that generated code, payloads, or curl commands will be accepted by the Trendyol API without modification. Always validate on the stage environment (`https://stageapigw.trendyol.com`) before sending requests to production.

---

## Production Safety

The plugin includes a Cursor hook (`hooks/pretool-guard-cursor.mjs`, registered on `beforeShellExecution` and `beforeMCPExecution`) that detects actions targeting the Trendyol production API URL (`https://apigw.trendyol.com`) and requires explicit user approval before they run. Stage actions are unaffected. This is a best-effort safety measure and does not replace proper testing, access control, or deployment review processes.

---

This plugin depends on the following external components:

| Component | Purpose | License |
|---|---|---|
| Trendyol Developer Tools MCP Server | API contract, validation, and generation server | Internal — Trendyol Group |
